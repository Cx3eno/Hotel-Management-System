Language Used: HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, MySQL

Project Executed on: XAMPP Server
OS: Win 11

In the 6th semester of the final year, I developed a Hotel Management System to streamline and simplify hotel service management and monitoring. The system was designed using HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.

Utilizing Visual Studio Code as the development environment, the project was executed on the XAMPP server, offering a robust platform for testing and deployment. The choice of Win 11 as the operating system facilitated seamless compatibility and enhanced performance.

The Hotel Management System encompassed various essential functionalities, including guest reservation, check-in/check-out procedures, room allocation, and billing. Additionally, it provided an intuitive admin dashboard, empowering hotel staff to manage room availability, customer data, and service requests efficiently.

The system's user interface was designed to be visually appealing and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience for both guests and hotel staff. Moreover, it featured a secure login system and data encryption to protect sensitive information.

Through this project, I honed my skills in web development, database management, and system integration. The Hotel Management System stands as a testament to my proficiency in utilizing various technologies to create practical and effective solutions for real-world challenges in the hospitality industry.
